## Pipe Service Package (PSP)

PSP Maintenance Model Notes:

### Objective


Eliminate the need for separate visits for tasks like CCTV inspection, pipe clearing, and manhole inspection --> Allow contractors to perform multiple maintenance activities in a single visit --> Streamline maintenance tasks

### Planning of PSP:

1. PSP task orders typically last 9-12 months.
2. Task order covers sewerage and stormwater assets within a specific zone.
3. Criteria for selecting areas include pipe age, previous inspection results, complaint records, and length of drainage assets.

### Execution of PSP:

- Key tasks include pipe clearing, CCTV inspection, highlighting pipes for rehabilitation, and considering manhole rehabilitation.
- Partner closely with the contractor for successful implementation.
- Regularly check costs and work progress; avoid double payments for tasks on the same pipe.
<p>![alt text](PSP%20flowchart.PNG)

### General Points:

- PSP covers small and medium pipes <750mm in diameter.
- Quick approval mechanism from district engineers for agile responses to pipe conditions.
- Avoid CCTV survey abandon cases to reveal more pipe structural grading information.
- Upload inspection results and lining records promptly to the AM/FM System.

### Importance of PSP:

1. Enhances efficiency by consolidating maintenance tasks --> single setup completes all the required maintanence tasks
2. Enables timely and effective maintenance of underground drainage systems.
3. Reduces the administrative burden of managing separate task orders.
