## Assessment of Liquidated Damages

What are the components within the LD assessment? 

1. Loss of revenue / interest on the capital invested on the project
2. Supervisory cost during the delayed period
3. Additiional sum payable in repect of fluctuation in the cost of labour and materials
4. Special damages


What determined whether the LD is enforceable or not?

It depends on whether the LD is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss likely to arise from the anticipated breach.

Why is the 

When is the minimum LD used? 

**???**

What happens when the LD rate is too large for contractors?

Procuring department can lower the rate to a commercially acceptable level by seeking the endorsement of ETWB and Secretary of the FSTB

What kind of checkings is needed for LD? 

1. Independent checking
2. Before Tender Invitation
3. During Tender Period
4. Before Issuance of Letter of Acceptance

## Pipe Service Package (PSP)

PSP Maintenance Model Notes:

### Objective


Eliminate the need for separate visits for tasks like CCTV inspection, pipe clearing, and manhole inspection --> Allow contractors to perform multiple maintenance activities in a single visit --> Streamline maintenance tasks

### Planning of PSP:

1. PSP task orders typically last 9-12 months.
2. Task order covers sewerage and stormwater assets within a specific zone.
3. Criteria for selecting areas include pipe age, previous inspection results, complaint records, and length of drainage assets.

### Execution of PSP:

- Key tasks include pipe clearing, CCTV inspection, highlighting pipes for rehabilitation, and considering manhole rehabilitation.
- Partner closely with the contractor for successful implementation.
- Regularly check costs and work progress; avoid double payments for tasks on the same pipe.
<p>![alt text](PSP%20flowchart.PNG)

### General Points:

- PSP covers small and medium pipes <750mm in diameter.
- Quick approval mechanism from district engineers for agile responses to pipe conditions.
- Avoid CCTV survey abandon cases to reveal more pipe structural grading information.
- Upload inspection results and lining records promptly to the AM/FM System.

### Importance of PSP:

1. Enhances efficiency by consolidating maintenance tasks --> single setup completes all the required maintanence tasks
2. Enables timely and effective maintenance of underground drainage systems.
3. Reduces the administrative burden of managing separate task orders.

# Construction Noise Permit (CNP)

### Obtained from "Technical Memorandum on Noise from Construction Work Other Than Precussive Piling"

Which ordinance does CNP relates to?  

    Noise Control Ordinance (Cap. 400)

What are the restricted horus for using powered mechanical equipment when there is no CNP?

    Restricted hours for using powered mechanical equipment is 7pm-7am. 

What are the steps in assessment of noise from construction works

1. Location of most affected Noise Sensitive Receiver (NSR)
2. Determination of the Area Sensitivity Rating (ASR)
    - ASR obtained by a matrix of Area Type against Degree of Effect, from A-C
    - NSR has a 100m radius in urban area and 500m in rural area. 
3. Determination of Basic Noise Level (BNL)
    - 2 Groups of time period (19:00-23:00 & 23:00-07:00)
    - Residential area originally with low influencing factor (less noisy) will have stricter Basic Noise Level requirement
4. Correction for Duration of Construction Noise Permit (CNP)
    - CNP less than 14 days will have a +3dB allowance 
5. Correction for Multiple Permit Situation
    - EPD can lower the BNL if there are multiple CNP near an NSR.
6. Determination of Acceptable Noise Level (ANL)
    - Computed by step 4,5
7. Location of items of Powered Mechanical Equipment (PME)
8. Sound Power Levels for Items of Powered Mechanical Equipment (PME)
    - The sound power level for each PME is different and is given by a table.
9. Distance Attenuation and Summation of Noise Levels
    - Distance to NSR = Plan/Slant Distance between source to any openings of NSR (window/ door)
    - if PME are used in the same location --> sound power level should be summed logarithmically to give Total Sound power Level
    - Predicted Noise Level (PNL) is given by a table taking into account the Distance to NSR & (Total) Sound Power Level
10. Corrections for the Effect of Barriers
    - a -10dB correction when there is full barrier blocking view of construction site from NSR.
    - a -5dB correction when there is barrier blocking view of all major PMEs
    - a -5dB correction when no window/door of NSR is directly facing the site
11. Corrections for the Effect of Barriers
    - a +3dB correction when NSR is in a building.
    - a +3dB correction when construction site is confined in nature.
12. Corrected Noise Level (CNL) at the Noise Sensitive Receiver
    - CNL = Sum of Step 10,11 
13. CNP Issuing Procedure
    - Compare Corrected Noise Level (CNL) with Acceptable Noise Level. 
    - There may be additional conditions or refuse to renew CNP based on the amount of complaints received and other factors.
    - All CNP PME should be labelled in a legible and conspicuous manner with the right identification code.  

![alt text](<miscellaneous Documents/Decibel Addition.PNG>)

What are the special condition in which CNP will be granted? 

- when it can be proven that construction during restricted hours will cause less inconvenience than non-restricted hours
- When serious interruption or disruption would be caused to road, railway, transport, and utilities. 
- When works needs to be carried out in specific tidal conditions
- Conditions of SNP will specify the use of specially silenaced items of PME. 
- When the construction works is of significant social implications

What are the Noise Measurement Procedures? 

- Assessment Point: for Buidlings, 1m away from exterior wall; for Construction site, height of 1.2m + location to be proposed by Authority
- Uses a Continuous Sound Pressure Level. Measured over 5-minute period
- Measurements to be adjusted based on weather conditions.
