# SCCT CPD: 

### New Construction Technologies 
- Box in Box MiC technology
    - Having non-structural steel frames inside MiC modules
        - increase flexibility in its interior design
        - Shorting construction time by allowing construction of Mic Module and the design of interior structure to be carried out in parallel
- Concrete Canvas
    - Geosynthetic Cementitious Composite Mats (GCCMs)
    - It is unrolled into place and hydrated for setting to take place.
    - 2 hour working window before setting begins
    - 24 hours until it reaches performance specifications
    - Downside: short shelf life. 

### New types of grouts: 
- Class C non-shrink grout
    Benefits:
      - High durability (resist shrinkage --> leading to cracks and damage over time)
      - Resistant to water and chemical
    Applications:
      - Anchor bolts
      - Reinforcement Steel
    Comparison with traditional grout:
      - normal grout tend to shrink as they cure --> gaps and reduced contact surface --> stress concentration & easy failure
      - normal grout have gaps after curing --> moisture ingress --> corrosion of steel reinforcement
    Comparison with other class non-shrink grout:
      Class A: Plastic (stiff) consistency, suitable for confined spaces that require rodding or tamping.
      Class C: Fluid (highly flowable) consistency, suitable for complex or extended areas that require easy, gravity-driven placement.
- deep fluid grout
- Ultra High Performacne Concrete (UHPC)
- Calcium Aluminosilicate (CAS) Cement
      - Allows up to 60% content of recycled materials. 

## Fibre Reinforced Polymer - Ultra High Strength - Engineered Geopolymer Concrete (FRP-UHS-EGC)
In normal concrete, strength and ductility are inversely related. Concrete with higher strength will crack easily under deformation, vice versa. 

Composition of UHS-EGC:

    - Matrix
        - Cement
        - Admixtures
        - Aggregates
        - Water
    - Fiber
        - Synthetic Fibre

#### Advantages of EGC over normal concrete
- 60% Lower carbon footprint <-- Geopolymers constitues local waste and activator, which are industrial by-products
- Enhanced long term tensile strength

#### Advantage of using PE fibers in EGC
- Even shear stress distribution in Shearing and Flexural casec
- Enables ductile failure during shearing instead of the usual brittle failure

Applicability of FRP-UHS-EGC:
- Marine Structures,

### Methods to Accelerate Superstructure Construction
- Adopting Table Formwork in lieu of traditional formwork
- Utilising high strength concrete 
    - Less time until formwork striking
    - Falsework removal

### GGBS

What is the advantage of using GGBS?
- Reduced risk of thermal cracking <-- Lower heat of hydration
- Reduced need for peak temperature control <-- Lower heat of hydration
- Lower water demand
- Improve workaibility
- Higher pozzolanic activity
- Less Aggregate Alkali-silica reaction (AAR) <-- Lower pH values 

### Silica Fume

It is added to GGBS concrete to minimise some shortcomings of GGBS
- Added into GGBS concrete in fine portion --> increases density and strength
- Reduces Drying shrinkage
- Reduces Bleeding of GGBS Concrete <-- Reduces Pores and improve homogeneity
