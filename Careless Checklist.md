## 2. Plan and Organize Your Work

1. **Clarify and Break Down the Task**  
   - [ ] Read all instructions thoroughly.  
   - [ ] Identify key requirements (e.g., deadlines, mandatory sections, specific data).  
   - [ ] Break the project into smaller tasks or sections.

2. **Create a Task Outline**  
   - [ ] List each sub-task in order (e.g., gather references, draft, proofread, finalize).  
   - [ ] Set rough deadlines or time estimates for each sub-task if needed.

3. **Set Checkpoints**  
   - [ ] Decide on “pause points” where you’ll review your progress.  
   - [ ] Create a mini-checklist for each checkpoint (e.g., data accuracy, formatting, references).

4. **Prepare References and Templates**  
   - [ ] Collect all relevant documents, templates, or previous examples before starting.  
   - [ ] Confirm you have the correct and most up-to-date versions.

5. **Establish a Focused Work Session**  
   - [ ] Close unrelated tabs and mute notifications.  
   - [ ] Work on one task at a time (avoid multitasking).

## 4. Review and Proofread in Layers

1. **First Pass – Content & Accuracy**  
   - [ ] Check that **all required information** (names, dates, data, references) is included.  
   - [ ] Verify **instructions vs. output**: Does this draft fulfill the original task or request?  
   - [ ] Ensure context has been updated correctly (e.g., if you copied from a colleague’s email or document, make sure the references and recipient details match your situation).

2. **Second Pass – Formatting & Consistency**  
   - [ ] Confirm headings, bullet points, numbering, and **indents** are correctly formatted.  
   - [ ] Check **signature post** (e.g., job title, company name) for accuracy and consistency.  
   - [ ] Verify **CC recipients** (if letters or emails require certain people to be copied).  
   - [ ] Check that terms, abbreviations, and references are used **consistently** throughout.  
   - [ ] Review fonts, margins, spacing, and style requirements (if applicable).

3. **Third Pass – Language & Grammar**  
   - [ ] Look for **spelling errors**, typos, and missing words.  
   - [ ] Watch for basic **grammar or punctuation** mistakes.  
   - [ ] Read the text aloud or use a text-to-speech tool to catch awkward phrasing.

4. **Final Sanity Check**  
   - [ ] Step away for a quick break if time allows.  
   - [ ] Return with fresh eyes for a final review:  
     - Check attachments or appendices are correct and included.  
     - Confirm recipients or distribution list is accurate.  
     - Verify subject lines or document titles.

### How to Use This Checklist

1. **Print it Out or Keep a Digital Copy**  
   - Make sure it’s always accessible where you usually work.

2. **Check Off Each Item**  
   - Actively tick items off as you go through each phase. This helps ensure no step is overlooked.

3. **Add Task-Specific Items**  
   - If your letters often need unique disclaimers, reference numbers, or specialized fields, add them to the checklist.

4. **Iterate Over Time**  
   - If you keep forgetting a certain detail, add it to the relevant section of the checklist.

By following these steps, you’ll build a structured habit that helps you systematically avoid common errors like missing CC recipients, formatting issues, or incorrect signatures—ultimately making you more efficient and reliable in your day-to-day work.
