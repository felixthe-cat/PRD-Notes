# Construction Noise Permit (CNP)

### Obtained from "[Technical Memorandum on Noise from Construction Work Other Than Precussive Piling](https://www.epd.gov.hk/epd/sites/default/files/epd/english/environmentinhk/noise/guide_ref/files/tm_nco400_eng.pdf)"

Which ordinance does CNP relates to?  

    Noise Control Ordinance (Cap. 400)

What are the restricted horus for using powered mechanical equipment when there is no CNP?

    Restricted hours for using powered mechanical equipment is 7pm-7am. 

What are the steps in assessment of noise from construction works

1. Location of most affected Noise Sensitive Receiver (NSR)
2. Determination of the Area Sensitivity Rating (ASR)
    - ASR obtained by a matrix of Area Type against Degree of Effect, from A-C
    - NSR has a 100m radius in urban area and 500m in rural area. 
3. Determination of Basic Noise Level (BNL)
    - 2 Groups of time period (19:00-23:00 & 23:00-07:00)
    - Residential area originally with low influencing factor (less noisy) will have stricter Basic Noise Level requirement
4. Correction for Duration of Construction Noise Permit (CNP)
    - CNP less than 14 days will have a +3dB allowance 
5. Correction for Multiple Permit Situation
    - EPD can lower the BNL if there are multiple CNP near an NSR.
6. Determination of Acceptable Noise Level (ANL)
    - Computed by step 4,5
7. Location of items of Powered Mechanical Equipment (PME)
8. Sound Power Levels for Items of Powered Mechanical Equipment (PME)
    - The sound power level for each PME is different and is given by a table.
9. Distance Attenuation and Summation of Noise Levels
    - Distance to NSR = Plan/Slant Distance between source to any openings of NSR (window/ door)
    - if PME are used in the same location --> sound power level should be summed logarithmically to give Total Sound power Level
    - Predicted Noise Level (PNL) is given by a table taking into account the Distance to NSR & (Total) Sound Power Level
10. Corrections for the Effect of Barriers
    - a -10dB correction when there is full barrier blocking view of construction site from NSR.
    - a -5dB correction when there is barrier blocking view of all major PMEs
    - a -5dB correction when no window/door of NSR is directly facing the site
11. Corrections for the Effect of Barriers
    - a +3dB correction when NSR is in a building.
    - a +3dB correction when construction site is confined in nature.
12. Corrected Noise Level (CNL) at the Noise Sensitive Receiver
    - CNL = Sum of Step 10,11 
13. CNP Issuing Procedure
    - Compare Corrected Noise Level (CNL) with Acceptable Noise Level. 
    - There may be additional conditions or refuse to renew CNP based on the amount of complaints received and other factors.
    - All CNP PME should be labelled in a legible and conspicuous manner with the right identification code.

What are the special condition in which CNP will be granted? 

- when it can be proven that construction during restricted hours will cause less inconvenience than non-restricted hours
- When serious interruption or disruption would be caused to road, railway, transport, and utilities. 
- When works needs to be carried out in specific tidal conditions
- Conditions of SNP will specify the use of specially silenaced items of PME. 
- When the construction works is of significant social implications

What are the Noise Measurement Procedures? 

- Assessment Point: for Buidlings, 1m away from exterior wall; for Construction site, height of 1.2m + location to be proposed by Authority
- Uses a Continuous Sound Pressure Level. Measured over 5-minute period
- Measurements to be adjusted based on weather conditions.
